To train all three algorithms, display train/test results and provide predictions for the 2016 race, run "recalculate.py" as 
a python program.  Note that sanity checks to validate the implementations on small 'toy' datasets are included but commented out.  
Similarly, code to produce the error plot shown in the report is commented out.

"cross_valid_run.py"  executes cross validation for the error threshold for logistic regression.  A line to execute for the
alpha learning rate parameter is commented out.

Processed datasets can be found in FinalDataSets/DataSetOn23rd.  Relevant to the final submission are Y1/Y2TrainSet, Y1/Y2TestSetExtended.

Required packages include numpy, pandas and progressbar2.

Python 3.5.2 was used to develop the code on the Anaconda platform on Windows 10 x64 Anniversary Update.
